easily change location where new cards added
handle merge conflicts in program
add key-value tag system
easy backup of reviews
metadata of cards separately, like suspended, custom tags etc
more exporting options
way to sort unfinished cards by how many cards they'd unlock lol, basically like, if 1 card has 2 unfinished depdencnies, then each dependency "unlocks" 0.5 cards, if two cards depend on 1 unfinished card, that cards unlocks 2 cards, works recursively
use health trackers to calculate recall rate?

# done
