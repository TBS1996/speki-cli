easily change location where new cards added
handle merge conflicts in program
add key-value tag system
easy backup of reviews
metadata of cards separately, like suspended, custom tags etc
more exporting options
way to sort unfinished cards by how many cards they'd unlock lol, basically like, if 1 card has 2 unfinished depdencnies, then each dependency "unlocks" 0.5 cards, if two cards depend on 1 unfinished card, that cards unlocks 2 cards, works recursively
use health trackers to calculate recall rate?

# thoughts


card types

# class

for example: Country, War, Person...
can also have sub-classes

for example, Woman is a sub-class of Person

# instance

a specific instance of a concept, so for example, WW2 is an instance of War, Marie Curie is an instance of Woman, which inherits Person, basically

# attribute

pre-defined questions for instances of a class. Each class can have some questions that are relevant to instances of its class. For example, when was {} born, can be under Person, then both instances of Male and Female will inherit that question, then you can have attributes specific to for example Female such as "whta is marie curies mtdna?
